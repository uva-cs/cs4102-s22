# Homeworks

## Unit D

#### D_Basic: Reductions and NP-Complete

* **Instructions:** The one and only basic homework for Unit D. Download the .tex file and add your answers to the questions in it. Put your answer right below each question. We've added a \solution{} LaTeX item where you can include your solution, if that helps. (If you don't use it, put the text **Solution** at the beginning of each answer.)
* Download [this file](../unitd/basic/cs4102_d-basic.tex) and modify it.
* Here's [the PDF](../unitd/basic/cs4102_d-basic.pdf) of this file (so you can look at the questions now if you wish).
* Due date: Tuesday, 5/3, 2022 at {\bf 11:30 pm.} Submit to GradeScope. 
* Late submissions: you may submit "late" up until Friday, 5/6, 2022 at {\bf 11:30 pm.} (Not 11:59, not midnight!) The penalty for a late submisssion is\ldots there is no penalty! **Note:** this is a hard deadline because we'll release solutions the next morning.

### Advanced Homework

* **Instructions:**  Download the .tex file and add your answers to the questions in it. Put your answer right below each question. This time we've added a \solution{} LaTeX item where you can include your solution, if that helps. (If you don't use it, put the text **Solution** at the beginning of each answer.)

* Due date: Tuesday, May 3, 2022 at **11:30 pm**. (Not 11:59, not midnight!)  Submit to GradeScope.
* Because we're at the end of term, there is no "early deadline" option for this HW. :-(

### Programming Homework

* **Instructions:**  See the homework description PDF file below for complete instructions.  You should download the set of starter code, which includes both Python and Java.  While each language is different, the algorithm will be the same, so choose the language you are familiar with.
* [Homework Instructions](../unitd/programming/unitD_programming.pdf) - Tiling Dino
* Starter Code:
    * [Python + Java package](../unitd/programming/unitD_programming.zip)
* Due date: May 3, **11:30pm**.  Submit to Gradescope.
    * **Note:** Gradescope will only run tests for and grade your first **15** submissions.  It's important to plan your algorithm before coding and write your own test cases.
    * To make sure your program compiles and runs on GradeScope, there is a "testing" submission site called **Unit D - Programming (Testing Only)** that will try your program against the images that we have given you in the Zip file. Make sure your program works here before you submit to the "real" GradeScope assignment with more test-cases that will be available later.
    * Only submit your **TilingDino** and supplement files (if needed).  You do not need to submit your test cases or Main file.
