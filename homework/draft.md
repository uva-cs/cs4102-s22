# Homeworks

## Unit B

### Solutions to Basic Homeworks

* [Unit B Basic #1](../unitb/basic/cs4102_b-basic1-solutions.pdf)
* [Unit B Basic #2](../unitb/basic/cs4102_b-basic2-solutions.pdf)


### Basic Homework

#### B1_Basic: BFS and DFS

* **Instructions:** The first (of two) basic homeworks for UnitB. Download the .tex file and add your answers to the questions in it. Put your answer right below each question. This time we've added a \solution{} LaTeX item where you can include your solution, if that helps. (If you don't use it, put the text **Solution** at the beginning of each answer.)
* Download [this file](../unitb/basic/latex/cs4102_b-basic1.tex) and modify it.
* Here's [the PDF](../unitb/basic/latex/cs4102_b-basic1.pdf) of this file (so you can look at the questions now if you wish).
* Due date: Friday, March 18, 2022 at {\bf 11:30 pm.} (Not 11:59, not midnight!)  Submit to GradeScope. **Note:** this is a hard deadline because we'll release solutions the next morning.

#### B2_Basic: DFS, Topological Sort, SCCs, Kruskal's, Prim's and Dijkstra's

* **Instructions:** The second (of two) basic homeworks for UnitB. Download the .tex file and add your answers to the questions in it. Put your answer right below each question. This time we've added a \solution{} LaTeX item where you can include your solution, if that helps. (If you don't use it, put the text **Solution** at the beginning of each answer.)
* Note: A update clarifying Problem 2.A was added to these files on 2/14 at 8:00 pm.
* Download [this file](../unitb/basic/latex/cs4102_b-basic2.tex) and modify it.
* You will also need these two image files:
    * [graph_DFS.png](../unitb/basic/latex/graph_DFS.png) and
    * [graph_MST1.png](../unitb/basic/latex/graph_MST1.png)
* Here's [the PDF](../unitb/basic/latex/cs4102_b-basic2.pdf) of this file (so you can look at the questions now if you wish).
* Due date: Friday, March 18, 2022 at {\bf 11:30 pm.} (Not 11:59, not midnight!)  Submit to GradeScope. **Note:** this is a hard deadline because we'll release solutions the next morning.

### Advanced Homework

* **Instructions:**  Download the .tex file and add your answers to the questions in it. Put your answer right below each question. This time we've added a \solution{} LaTeX item where you can include your solution, if that helps. (If you don't use it, put the text **Solution** at the beginning of each answer.)
* Download [this file](../unitb/advanced/cs4102_b-adv.tex) and modify it.
* You will also need this image files: [vulnerable-sets.png](../unitb/advanced/vulnerable-sets.png)
* Here's [the PDF](../unitb/advanced/cs4102_b-adv.pdf) of this file (so you can look at the questions now if you wish).
* Due date: Friday, April 8, 2022 at {\bf 11:30 pm.} (Not 11:59, not midnight!)  Submit to GradeScope.


### Programming Homework

* **Instructions:**  See the homework description PDF file below for complete instructions.  You should download one of the sets of starter code for your chosen programming languages.  While each language is different, the algorithm will be the same, so choose the language you are familiar with.
* [Homework Instructions](../unitb/programming/cs4102_b-programming.pdf) - Choosing Mars Pioneers
* Starter Code:
    * [Python package](../unitb/programming/python.zip)
    * [Java package](../unitb/programming/java.zip)
    * [C++ package](../unitb/programming/cpp.zip)
* Due date: April 15, 11:30pm.  Submit to Gradescope.  **Submissions with test cases will open Fri., April 1.**
    * **Note:** Gradescope will only run tests for and grade your first **20** submissions.  It's important to plan your algorithm before coding and write your own test cases.
    * Only submit your **Supply** and supplement files (if needed).  You do not need to submit your test cases or Main file.
