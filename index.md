# CS4102 Algorithms - Spring 2022

**Course Description:** Introduces the analysis of algorithms and the
effects of data structures on them. Algorithms selected from areas such
as sorting, searching, shortest paths, greedy algorithms, backtracking,
divide-and-conquer, and dynamic programming. Data structures include
heaps and search, splay, and spanning trees. Analysis techniques include
asymptotic worst-case, expected time, amortized analysis, and reductions
between problems

**Availability (new):** It is important to us to be available to our students, and to address their concerns. If you cannot connect with either of us during our office hours, e-mail us and we will find the time to meet virtually. That being said, like everybody else we are quite busy, so it may take a day or more to find a time to meet. And if you have any comments on the course---what is working, what is not working, what can be done better, etc.---we are very interested in hearing about them.  Please send Prof. Hott, Prof. Horton, or one of the TAs an e-mail or post privately on Piazza to the instructors.

# Homework Deadlines and Exam Dates

## Important notes:

- Basic Homeworks will be due at 11:30 pm on the Friday before the exam, except for Unit D's which are due on the last day of class. This will be a **hard deadline** because we will release the solutions sometime the following morning.

- Advanced Homeworks:  There is a soft deadline and a hard deadline.
   - If you submit by the soft deadline, we will commit to giving you feedback within about a week, which will give you a few days to update your solution before the hard deadline.
   - If you submit after the soft deadline, we will try but won't guarantee you'll get feedback before the hard deadline.
   - You may submit solutions at most twice: once to get some feedback, and the second as you final submission.
   
- Program Deadlines:  They have a hard deadline that is the same as that unit's hard deadline for Advanced Homeworks.  They'll be submitted to GradeScope and run against test-cases. You'll be able to re-submit multiple times, but it's possible that for some program we may limit how many times you can submit. (See each assignment for details.)

- Chance to re-take unit exams:
    - Unit A:  The re-take will be in class on 3/15 (right after spring break, right before the withdrawal deadline).
    - Unit B and Unit C:  You can re-take either or both of these during the final exam period.
    - Unit D: This will be given during the final exam period, and there will not be a chance to re-take it. 
    - If you re-take an exam, there is no penalty, and your highest of the two scores will be counted.
