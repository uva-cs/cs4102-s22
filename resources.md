# Resources

The topics we will cover are difficult to master.  Below are resources to help with foundational concepts, including proof techniques and additional practice problems.

#### LaTeX Resources
The pen-and-paper (a.k.a. "written") assignments are not really pen-and-paper: they must be typeset with LaTeX, a professional formatting system. Tutorials on how to use LaTeX are provided with Homework 1A. LaTeX is easily installable on many computers: 
- Overleaf, [overleaf.com](http://overleaf.com): a Web-hosted LaTeX editor which behaves much like Google Docs.
- Cygwin (which you may have seen in CS 2150) has LaTeX packages that can be installed
- MiKTeX provides a stand-alone installer for Windows and Mac, [miktex.org](http://miktex.org)
- Ubuntu and CentOS provide TeXLive packages in their repos
- LyX, TexShop, and TeXStudio are GUI editors available either through the MiKTeX and TeXLive repos or available as separate downloads.

We strongly recommend using Overleaf, [overleaf.com](http://overleaf.com), since it contains all the necessary packages and works in-browser. We generally will not accept LaTeX documents with images of text or formulas; **you must typeset the formulas in LaTeX**, not in another program and have them exported as images.
