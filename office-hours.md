## TA Office Hours

TA office hours are available every day except Friday and Saturday. Information can be found below. There are three possible types of office hours:

- **In-Person OH**: Some OH will be held in-person in OLS 011 and will be held 7-10 pm. See the chart below for details. These will function as *traditional* office hours.

- **Discord OH**: Some OH will be held on our **Discord Server**. To attend office hours, simply join the office hours queue voice channel and you will be added to the office hours queue. When you are taken off the queue you will be automatically moved to a staging room to wait (it is called *oh-up-next* or similar). Soon after, a TA will manually pull you off that staging room into their office hours to help you.

- **Group Sessions**: We will probably schedule some group sessions with special purposes (e.g. review before the exam, getting started on Program C, etc.).  Watch for announcements about these.
