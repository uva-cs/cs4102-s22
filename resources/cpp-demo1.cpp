 * A function to demo C++'s pair class and how to sort vector of pairs using comparator.
 *   See the helper functions at end to see how to access each item in pair.

 *   https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-vector-of-pairs-in-c-set-1-sort-by-first-and-second/
 * C++ sort() function takes the range of vector to sort as first two parameters, and optionally
 *   a comparator function as a 3rd argument, which works like Java's comparators to show
 *   how to compare two vector-items inside the sort.
